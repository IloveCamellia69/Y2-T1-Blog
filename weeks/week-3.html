					<h3>Prototypes</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-1rem font-courier font-colour">
					<p>
						After making the paper prototype and getting some feed
						back from users. I started to make turn those suggested
						changes from paper to digital prototypes.
					</p>
					<img
						src="../images/week3/moblie-proto.png"
						alt="Mobile Prototype"
					/>
					<p>
						But after playing around with the digital lofi prototype
						the concept of the solution slowly started to change and
						evolve. It started off as a tik tok like format to make
						not liking how things were placed and then it slowly
						started to change in to a card like format. With this
						new format but still the same content. I mapped out what
						i wanted the new website to look like. It could have
						been from a simple website layout of having cards placed
						in a generic manner. Or i could also have gone, still a
						similer tik toc style of having the main content in a
						scrollable format like how the tik toks website it.
					</p>
					<img
						src="../images/week3/website-mockup.png"
						alt="website-mockup"
					/>
					<p>
						In the end ive decided to do a mash between these two.
						There would be a main scrollable section in a grid
						format and on the side there would be the latest and
						head lines section. The main section would be dedicated
						to the content for the viewer or what the website thinks
						the viewer would like.
					</p>
					<p>
						I laid out the content too see if i liked the layout of
						the new design with the new cards and it turned out to
						look like a design website.
					</p>
					<p>
						When i did that i realized that the original idea didnt
						have a good identity for it because it was so based off
						of tik tok.
					</p>
					<img
						src="../images/week3/website-test.png"
						alt="Website test"
					/>
					<p>
						I moved onto creating a mid-fi prototype and fully
						creating a news dashboard. Ive created 2 version of the
						but essentially its just the same thing with different
						pages. I did this to see how things would look.
					</p>
					<img src="../images/week3/mid-1.png" alt="mid fi 1" />
					<img src="../images/week3/mid-2.png" alt="mid fi 2" />
					<p>
						After creating both i just scrapped the first one in
						favour of the on with the most articles and profile.
						this is mainly because the overall design of the website
						since i wasnt planning on having a footer at the bottom
						of the page, but instead having the footer in the about
						page. Yes having the the about page for a ready to test
						prototype would be me crossing my eyes and dotting my Ts
						but i thought not having it would be a better
						representation of how the website would be for the
						target audience because there wouldnt be any need to
						have an about us because they might just not be
						interested in it at all.

						</li>
						<li>
							Didn’t know that the content is scroll able
							<br />should add one to indicate the there are more
							content
						</li>
						<li>
							They expected that if the user was not logged in

						</li>
						<li>
							felt that a category selector would be a nice to
							have for ease of finding the topic you like
						</li>
						<li>
							an article pop up would feel much more easy to use
							then a article page, or just a quick article peak
						</li>
						<li>no scroll indication</li>

					<h4>Testing synthesis:</h4>

				<div class="text-content font-1rem font-courier font-colour">
					<ul>
						<li>
							- Scroll indication is needed <br />

							This has been the one feedback that has been echoed
							out in all 3 of the user testing session making it
							the main issue that I need to fix.
						</li>
						<li>
							- Article selector <br />

							The article topic selector has also shown un in 2 of
							the 3 feedback sections. This was unexpected from
							the users end as they thought in the prototype that
							there would be that function but there wasn’t.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Other from these 2 main things that have popped up in 2
						or more user testing session the other feedback is also
						really useful for me to take in as they would represent
						some of the QoL things that a website might have the i
						didnt know about and should implement
