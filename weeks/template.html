					<h3>Research Summary</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-courier font-colour font-1rem">
					<p>
						This research provides a comprehensive analysis of how
						Generation Z consumes news in the current digital age.
						It highlights that Gen Z primarily relies on social
						media and online sources that cater to their interests.
						They have a preference for highly visual, shareable
						content that is relatable to their daily life
						experiences. As opposed to traditional news, Gen Z is
						more interested in progress and enjoyment, focusing on
						lifestyle and culture.
					</p>
					<p>
						To effectively reach this younger generation, media
						organizations need to provide quick, easy-to-digest
						information that avoids bias or information overload.
						Gen Z's short attention span means that they are less
						likely to dedicate time to reading newspapers and more
						likely to "snack" on news that interests them. TikTok is
						becoming a major source of information and education for
						Generation Z, similar to how Google is for other age
						groups.
					</p>

					<p>
						The research also highlights how this trend is affecting
						industries such as journalism and advertising, as they
						adapt to the changing ways in which younger generations
						consume content. Media organizations must tailor their
						content to Gen Z's preferences by using eye-catching
						visuals and multimedia, presenting information in a
						concise and engaging manner, and focusing on issues that
						affect Gen Z's daily life. News should be delivered via
						online platforms and social media that Gen Z frequents.
						Some suggestions for making news relatable and shareable
						for Gen Z include telling personal stories, using an
						informal writing style, and incorporating internet
						culture and memes when appropriate.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, it is important for media organizations to
						maintain journalistic integrity by reporting facts and
						avoiding bias even when catering to Gen Z's interests.
						Overall, understanding Gen Z's unique perspectives and
						needs is key to keeping them informed and interested in
						the news.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to discussing how Gen Z consumes news, the
						document also provides information regarding how Gen Z
						workers in the workplace feel about their work. The
						focus group revealed that they are desensitized by the
						news, and that news can affect how they feel about work.
						They prefer designed articles and always want to consume
						content, but do not want their time to be wasted.
