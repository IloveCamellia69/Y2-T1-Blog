					<h3>Field Review</h3>
				</div>
				<div
					class="text-content font-courier font-1rem font-colour-accent"
				>
					<p>
						This is a field review that I'm doing to get a better
						gauge on what current new websites are doing and to
						critique the websites to see what they're doing right or
						wrong. Since my target audience is Gen Z I will also
						look at these websites from my perspective to see what
						can be change, improved and worked on in order to try
						and get Gen Z reading the news and keeping up.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-courier font-1rem font-colour">
					<p>
						I started of with finding news sites to look at by
						searching “News websites” in google as it was the
						quickest way to get different selections and types of
						websites that people use. I took all the websites from
						the first page and opened them to get a first impression
						of the site. After opening them I’ve noticed that there
						were 3 different types of sites that I can see from
						first impressions. Semi dense, dense, and pop-ups. Below
						I have linked and categorized them accordingly.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="week-sub-title font-elze font-2rem font-colour">
					<h4>Semi dense</h4>
					<img
						src="../images/week2/semi-dense.jpg"
						alt="semi dense websites "
					/>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-courier font-1rem font-colour">
					<p>
						These semi dense websites are in the name suggests, semi
						dense. They all have a nicely styled and laid out
						website giving each article their own space to sit in.
						This gives the impression that the articles presented
						are to a degree, somewhat important/daily headline(in my
						opinion/impression). This lends itself well to and small
						degree as based off of my research, Gen Z doesn't like
						to read a wall of text, something that isn't stylized or
						look nice. So applying the rule of 1/3s and overall
						visual style makes the website more appealing. However
						in saying that, Newsroom and Time both start to get into
						that dense category when scrolling down revealing
						compact layout making it feel like one mass of images
						and text with no end. This is the opposite for Vox. At
						first is a small section of dense compact headlines
						labeled “Top stories”. Then upon scrolling down articles
						are aligned in a single column of cards which makes
						things much easier to read and adds structure to the
						website.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are also very little to no ads on these websites.
						But this might be caused by my ad blockers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="week-sub-title font-elze font-2rem font-colour">
					<h4>Dense</h4>
					<img
						src="../images/week2/dense.jpg"
						alt="dense websites "
					/>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-courier font-1rem font-colour">
					<p>
						The majority of the websites were categorized as dense
						because its just lots of information dump on so many
						different topics. This makes the website hard to easily
						read which drives away Gen Z as they don’t like
						information being pushed to them also making hard to
						digest. This is a major pain points for Gen Z who are
						trying to get into reading the news but are having a
						hard time because the news websites aren’t designed to
						be visuals first.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite popular belief or is may just be me, there are
						little to no ads on these new sites. This may be caused
						by my ad blockers doing its job but this cant be
						overlooked. Ads are fundamentally intrusive. They can
						ruin the experience of the users when trying to find
						what they need on a website. This is also a major factor
						in driving people away from website. Theres little to no
						good things to say about these websites aside from they
						serve you all the information at once if thats what
						you're into. But that’s not what Gen Z is into.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="week-sub-title font-elze font-2rem font-colour">
					<h4>Pop-ups</h4>
					<img
						src="../images/week2/pop-ups.jpg"
						alt="dense websites "
					/>
				</div>
				<div class="text-content font-courier font-1rem font-colour">
					<p>
						And lastly the pop-up site. Pop-ups act as a great way
						to get people to do something you want them to do. Like
						signing up to a news letter, become a subscriber, or
						serving an ad. The one glairing issue with pop-ups is
						that its also super intrusive. I almost ALT+ F4 and
						closed the site as soon as I opened it just out of
						habit/instinct of how much I disliked pop-up. Yes pop-up
						are really intrusive and stop you from doing what you
						want. But it doesn’t stop there, the pop-up actively try
						to get you to do something. From the research that I did
						Gen Z doesn’t like being told what to do by these
						websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even if someone closes out the pop-up they will get
						bombarded with super dense information that the website
						presents all at once over whelming the user and
						potentially driving them away from the site.
					</p>
					<p>
						All these intrusive things like ads and pop-ups compound
						together on top of a compact and hard to read website
						layout put up may barriers to entry for users which is
						not what you want if you want people to be on your site.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the little attention span and high demands that Gen
						Z have its really hard to format news in a why that
						tells the full story while begin so short that some can
						read it in a few seconds. But another way to do things
						is to make the experience of reading the news better.
						Removing the pop-ups and ads help bring down the
						barriers of entry down, and a stylized/designed website
						with well thought out visual hierarchy, content
						presentation and format could increase the amount of the
						Gen Z audience reading news. But making a redesign isnt
						enough. Since most Gen Z are on social media, you would
						also have to design a easy, efficient and quick way to
						present the news on other social media platform as well,
						not just your own website.

							Tik Tok is one of if not the more popular social
							media apps in the word. It presents its content in a
							way here its short, easy to access, and addicting
							for all its users. With its format of presenting its
							content in a vertical format it allows the users to
							change through content with a simple swipe. However
							there is a problem with this. You don’t know what
							content is going to come next. But Tik Tok has a
							very powerful algorithm to serve content to its
							users ensuring that they stay on the app as long as
							possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is now a proven format for serving content to
							its target audience. Yes scrolling content has been
							here for a long time but only now it has blown up in
							the size that it is now.
						</p>
						<p>
							There’s plenty of other platforms that have copied
							this format such as, Instagram reels and Youtube
							shorts to varying outcomes and user responses. But
							basing off of thag other major companies have used
							this format in their website i can say that this is
							a tested format of delivering short and quick
							content to its end users.
