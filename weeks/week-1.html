				<h3>Research</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text-content">
				<p>
					This research provides a comprehensive analysis of how
					Generation Z consumes news in the current digital age. It
					highlights that Gen Z primarily relies on social media and
					online sources that cater to their interests. They have a
					preference for highly visual, shareable content that is
					relatable to their daily life experiences. As opposed to
					traditional news, Gen Z is more interested in progress and
					enjoyment, focusing on lifestyle and culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					To effectively reach this younger generation, media
					organizations need to provide quick, easy-to-digest
					information that avoids bias or information overload. Gen
					Z's short attention span means that they are less likely to
					dedicate time to reading newspapers and more likely to
					"snack" on news that interests them. TikTok is becoming a
					major source of information and education for Generation Z,
					similar to how Google is for other age groups.
				</p>

				<p>
					The research also highlights how this trend is affecting
					industries such as journalism and advertising, as they adapt
					to the changing ways in which younger generations consume
					content. Media organizations must tailor their content to
					Gen Z's preferences by using eye-catching visuals and
					multimedia, presenting information in a concise and engaging
					manner, and focusing on issues that affect Gen Z's daily
					life. News should be delivered via online platforms and
					social media that Gen Z frequents. Some suggestions for
					making news relatable and shareable for Gen Z include
					telling personal stories, using an informal writing style,
					and incorporating internet culture and memes when
					appropriate.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, it is important for media organizations to maintain
					journalistic integrity by reporting facts and avoiding bias
					even when catering to Gen Z's interests. Overall,
					understanding Gen Z's unique perspectives and needs is key
					to keeping them informed and interested in the news.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to discussing how Gen Z consumes news, the
					document also provides information regarding how Gen Z
					workers in the workplace feel about their work. The focus
					group revealed that they are desensitized by the news, and
					that news can affect how they feel about work. They prefer
					designed articles and always want to consume content, but do
					not want their time to be wasted.
